# Overview

Here you can find all my work related to Finance, which I have been working on since I started to learn programming with python. 
I also have some projects where I implemented Machine Learning on some Finance topics which are based on scientific papers about the usage of Machine Learning in the Finance sector.

# Motivation

Since I have a Finance backround and always had a passion for programming and everything IT relevant, it was clear for me to focus learning how to use programming for Finance. 
My goal is it to become an expert in the field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in the Finance sector.
