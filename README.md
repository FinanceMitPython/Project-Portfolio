# Project-Portfolio
Here you can find what I have worked on so far. Since I have a Finance background I try to focus a lot of my projects on topics in that sector. For Data Science tasks and projects I like to experiment with a lot of different data sets, which I mostly find on www.kaggle.com. For AI projects I use the Open AI gym library which offers different enviroments to work with.
