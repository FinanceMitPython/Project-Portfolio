# Project-Portfolio
Here you can find what I have worked on so far. Since I have a Finance background I try to focus a lot of my projects on topics in that sector. For Data Science tasks and projects I like to experiment with a lot of different data sets, which I mostly find on www.kaggle.com. For AI projects I use the Open AI gym library which offers different enviroments to work with.

# Frameworks 
I mainly use Python with Jupyter Notebooks for my projects. Jupyter Notebooks are very commonly used for Data Science and all kind of data analyzation which is perfectly for Finance Data. 

# How I got into Machine Learning / Data Science
My first contact in this field I got in a university modul called "Computer Bases Investmeny Analysis". There I started to use R for Data analysis and did a small project on the Random Forest Classifier for marketing bank data. I was really impressed by Machine Learning that I decided to dive deeper into this topic. I started to inform myself about Machine Learning and Data Science and bought some courses on udemy about Python programming, Data Science and Machine Learning.
